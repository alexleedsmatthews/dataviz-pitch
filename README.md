# Final Project Pitch 09/27

### Option A: Affordability of Employer-sponsored insurance

*Background/overview*: I’m currently helping to author a report for policymakers and the public about the affordability of employer-sponsored health insurance. Specifically, we are looking at why, despite ACA reforms, the cost of insurance and health care continues growing for workers, relative to inflation and wages, and health care seems to cost more for low--income workers both in relative and absolute terms.
- Goal: Demonstrate the costs of job-based health care for workers of various demographics in California. For example, see what a low-income woman of color with no children might be making at a small firm.
- 
- Data sources: [California Employee Health Benefits Survey](https://www.chcf.org/publication/2019-edition-california-employer-health-benefits/) (by the California Health Care Foundation), [KFF data](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/report/2019-employer-health-benefits-survey/).

- Questions:  
 - How much do people spend on health care both in absolute terms and relative to their income?
 - What aspects of health care are driving the cost--are employees paying a lot because they are offered and opt for high deductible plans or is the coinsurance insane or are the premiums high? 
 - How does it vary depending on your location, race, sex, family structure, job title, or firm size?

- Visualization techniques: Ideally, I would like to make this interactive in the way the rent affordability graphic is--in that I want people to be able to test out various demographics, and see what the average deductible, premium, etc. looks like and also so people can compare two different options. Kaiser Family Foundation put together something akin to what I’d like to do [here](https://www.kff.org/interactive/premiums-and-worker-contributions-among-workers-covered-by-employer-sponsored-coverage-1999-2019/). But if I can find the county-specific data, I’d love to integrate that and some other demographic factors. That said, re-creating the KFF graphic using California-specific data is probably more than ambitious enough for my skill level.





### Option B: Digital ad transparency databases
*Background/overview*: This summer I worked at a democracy reform nonprofit called Issue One, examining Google, Twitter, and Facebook’s political advertising databases. The databases are a rich source of story ideas, but the data is also messy and incomplete. I’m raising this project now even though I don’t have a specific story idea because I hope playing with visualizations in these databases will help me interview the data and find an interesting angle. I spent all summer working in these databases, so I’m intimately familiar with how they work, now I just need to figure out what the story angle is.

- Goal: Create a visualization that helps me see more clearly the interesting stories in this data.
- Data sources: [Google](https://transparencyreport.google.com/political-ads/region/US?hl=en) and possibly [Twitter](https://ads.twitter.com/transparency) and [Facebook’s](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?ad_type=political_and_issue_ads) ad databases. (Google’s data is the most robust)
- Questions:
 - What’s the presence of dark money groups in these databases like?
 - What kind of messaging do political groups use in these platforms?
 - Which political groups and leanings are most active?
 - Despite the efforts of these organizations to offer transparency in the form of these databases, they are self-policed, and a lot of bots and opaque groups slip through the cracks. Where are the biggest gaps in enforcement and transparency? Which political groups are exploiting these gaps the most?
- Visualization techniques: Maybe a word cloud or frequency map to understand what language is being used and which groups and political influences are most active in these online platforms and how they are most commonly used.
